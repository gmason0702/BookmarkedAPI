# BookmarkedAPI

Our book-tracking application includes a rating feature as well as the ability to create a custom book club. Bookmarked caters to book lovers who are able to, through our app, locate books theyâ€™ve read and rated. On top of that, users will be able to join a community of like-minded readers in the form of a book club. Our developers created this application based on a common interest in books and the idea of implementing a virtual book club.
